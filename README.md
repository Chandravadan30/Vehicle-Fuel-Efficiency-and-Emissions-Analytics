# Vehicle-Fuel-Efficiency-and-Emissions-Analytics


This project is an end-to-end data analytics platform developed as part of a graduate course at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). It integrates environmental and automotive datasets to explore trends in CO₂ emissions, vehicle fuel economy, and electric vehicle adoption between 2015 and 2025.

## Overview

Due to rising environmental concerns and regulatory pressures, this project aims to help stakeholders—including automakers, government agencies, consumers, and environmental groups—make data-driven decisions for sustainable transportation.

Key features include:
- Data warehouse design using SQL Server
- ETL pipelines built with SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)
- Interactive Power BI dashboards
- Insights into emissions trends, fuel efficiency, and EV market share

---

## Technologies Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** – Data storage and querying
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)** – ETL pipeline creation
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboarding
- **Python** – Initial data cleaning and merging
- **Data Sources**: EPA, NOAA, Global Carbon Atlas, Bureau of Transportation Statistics

## ETL Workflow (SSIS)

* **Extract**: Load raw CSVs using flat file sources.
* **Transform**:

  * Clean missing and null values
  * Normalize fuel type strings and date formats
  * Calculate new KPIs (e.g., CO₂ per vehicle, fuel cost efficiency)
* **Load**: Push to normalized SQL Server tables

---

## Dashboard Insights (Power BI)

* **CO₂ vs. Average Temperature** (2015–2025)
* **Electric vs. Fuel Vehicle Sales Trends**
* **Fuel Efficiency Leaders by Make and Model**
* **Top Low CO₂ Emission Vehicles**
* **Fuel Type Distribution Across Years**
* **City-wise CO₂ Emission Trends**

---

## Key Outcomes

* Identified leading low-emission and high-efficiency vehicle models
* Tracked rise in EV market share and regional CO₂ patterns
* Demonstrated positive correlation between emissions and temperature rise
* Delivered visual tools to support sustainable transportation planning
